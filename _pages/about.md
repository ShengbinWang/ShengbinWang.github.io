# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Mechanical Engineering Department](http://www.me.uh.edu//) at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zheng Chen](http://brcl.me.uh.edu/). [[Curriculum Vitae](http://www.me.uh.edu/sites/me-new/files/faculty/chen-zheng/chen_zheng.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=edyNnjYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of Bio-inspired Robotics and Controls, particularly in soft robot fabrication, controller design and self-sensing with feedback control, as well as the controller with machine learning.
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Huazhong Agricultural University](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/) and Master's Degree in [hefei university of technology](http://www.hfut.edu.cn/).
