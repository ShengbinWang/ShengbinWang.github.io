# About Me
* I'm a passionate advocate for the intersection of machine learning, data science, and robotics. I thrive on extracting insights from complex datasets and translating them into actionable solutions. But my love for coding extends beyond analytics, I'm also keen on diving into software engineering projects, constantly seeking new challenges to hone my skills. When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you'll often find me exploring the great outdoors. Hiking, rock climbing, and traveling are not just hobbies for me, they're avenues for inspiration and rejuvenation, fueling my creativity and drive.
* I earned my Ph.D. degree from the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zheng Chen](http://brcl.me.uh.edu/). 
* I also obtained a Master of Science in Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree from [Huazhong Agricultural University](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/) and my Master's Degree from [HeFei University of Technology](http://www.hfut.edu.cn/).
